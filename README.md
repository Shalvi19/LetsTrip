# LetsTrip
Trip manager for planning your own trip, with the best food, places and to-do-things aggregated in one application.

The application will provide information about selected destination like what places should be visited if you are in that city, for example if you are in Mumbai, you wouldn't wanna miss watching sunset at Elephanta Caves, then information about which food to definitely try, for example in Bhopal you have to try poha and jalebi and the exact location where to find it, also, the information about what activities to do like on the way to Karela there is a bridge where you can enjoy bunjee jumping in front of a waterfall which not most people know about, and, the imformation about what things to buy for sure at that place and shopping destinations, like in Mumbai you can find better designed clothes at linking street then at alpha stores.

All this information is surely available at google but you have to go through minimum 15-20 sites for the reliable information, so, our job is to get all this information in one application. We do it by aggregating reviews and blogs and other google sites to get reliable information.

Also, people can add information about any place that they think others should know about. But first the place would be verified and that the information would be visible to others.

These are the basic functionalities we are focussing on rigth now and then enhance it such that it can update the information using ML gettings it directly from different sites, also, at first we are going to include only one city's information right now and then move to others. 

Also the name is temporary, we are going to think about a better name later.
